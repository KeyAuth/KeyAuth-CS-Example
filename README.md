# KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example

This is a temporary repository due to a contributor of the last repository violating the GitHub ToS in one of his commits. I was not aware of this, and I removed the code that violated the GitHub ToS. I have made GitHub aware this was a contributor, not myself, and that I will vet my contributors better in the future. For the time being, this repo with no stars or forks will stand until the original one is hopefully restored.
